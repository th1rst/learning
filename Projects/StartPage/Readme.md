THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Since I don't like the privacy-invading nature of Google and other big tech companies alike, I liked the idea of making a privacy Startpage which provides access to great open source alternatives.
Stumbling accross Gridstack.js, I thought it would be cool if you could drag around the individual elements.

The end goal is to have a customizable StartPage where you can choose what service you like to see. 
As a bonus, I'd like to implement a feature where you can store your user data locally and set it up to(automatically?) upload them on page load so no user information is stored on any server.

Currently implemented:
- Customizable Grid
- DuckDuckGo Search Bar
- Openstreetmap (Openroute) Directions
- OpenWeatherMap API Call (currently fixed set to Berlin)
- Sidebar (no real functions yet, just the sidebar itself)


What I like to implement in the future (in order):
- Sidebar usage of adding/removing items
- News / RSS Feed + customization later on
- Individual Resizing of Grid Items
- YouTube search via an alternative Frontend (Invidious) but that might just end up as a search bar
as they don't have an embed feature or an API
- Maybe a Spotify Search
- Some kind of Notes-App eventually
- An alternative to Google Translate
- whatever comes into mind, any input is highly appreciated


Since this is my first own project besides Tutorial tasks, I'd like to stick to the basics.

Technologies used so far:

- HTML
- CSS including Flexbox Elements
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Bootstrap 4
- FontAwesome
- Gridstack.js
