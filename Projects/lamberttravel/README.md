This is my second attempt of using React.

A mockup Travel agency Website that is then going to display backend data and lets the user filter through it.
For each section (double economy, beachfront luxurious etc.) there is going to be a Hero-component.

For the Backend I will be using Contentful and set up a mockup database for (semi-) luxurious Hotel rooms.

Will update the Readme as I code along.
