Using the Giphy API, I will try to recreate their Website (in basic form). 
One thing I'd like to implement is infinite scroll.

This is my first tinkering with React.
I like the components so far, but still a bit confused. Will update. 


Problems I've encountered:
- getting the user input is a whole lot different than in Vanilla JS
- the user input is asynchronous (had to use async/await or the last character was missing)
