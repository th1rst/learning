## Kaufmann's Recipe Site (German)

This is my third React project and will be more of a "real" website because it is filled with real content.

A recipe site with my grandfather's collection of ~180 phenomenal recipes. Those recipes were published as a book once and the PDF file will be available as a free download (240 pages, dual page Layout)
All recipes and ingredients are written in German. 

### Tech Stack: 
- Frontend: React, React Router, React Context API
- Styling: Custom CSS, React-Bootstrap, React-Icons
- Backend: Contentful API.

The only thing missing is a Backend with an Email-Server so the contact form is a dummy for now.

The Website is fully responsive and I made two seperate versions of the Navbar (Desktop and Mobile) as well as several Breakpoints for scaling.
