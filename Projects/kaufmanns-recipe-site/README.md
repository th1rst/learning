## Kaufmann's Recipe Site (German)

This is my third React project and will be a "real" website with its own domain.

A recipe site with my grandfather's collection of ~180 phenomenal recipes. Those recipes were published as a book once and the PDF file will be available as a free download (240 pages, dual page Layout)
Since the Website will target a German audience, the content will be 100% in german.

### Tech Stack: 
- Frontend: React, React Router, React Context API
- Styling: Custom CSS, React-Bootstrap, React-Icons
- Backend: Contentful API.

The only thing missing is a Backend with an Email-Server so the contact form is a dummy for now.

The Website is fully responsive and I made two seperate versions of the Navbar (Desktop and Mobile) as well as several Breakpoints for scaling.

Will update the Readme as I code along.
