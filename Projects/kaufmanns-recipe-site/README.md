This is my third React project and will be a "real" website with its own domain.

A recipe site with my grandfather's collection of ~180 phenomenal recipes (which, in fact, were published as a book once).
Since the Website will target a german audience, the content will be 100% in german.

Tech Stack: 
Frontend: React, React Router, React Context API
Styling: Custom CSS, React-Bootstrap, React-Icons
Backend: Contentful API.

The Website is fully responsive and I made two seperate versions of the Navbar (Desktop and Mobile) as well as several Breakpoints for scaling.

Will update the Readme as I code along.
