## Welcome to my small selection of training files. 

At first, I started with countless Tutorials like FreeCodeCamp, CodeCademy and last but not least "JavaScript 30" - until I decided that I wanted to leave "Tutorial Hell" and just start building things.

Quickly, I jumped from Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS to React, since I like the reusability of React's Components and because I like "dynamic" pages that are not just static sites.

### Projects in chronological order (old to new):
- **1. Rhyme Checker**
  a simple static page that uses the (open) Datamuse API. Vanilla JS, Simple HTML, a bit of Bootstrap.

- **2. "Startpage"**
  an attempt at making a more privacy-friendly version of a Startpage with FOSS alternatives. It uses Gridstack.js to move "Widgets" around and lock them into place.
  Widgets can be added/removed and the Layout gets saved in LocalStorage.
  Vanilla JS, a bit of jQuery, Gridstack.js, Bootstrap.

- **3. SampleRestaurant**
  a simple "Landing Page" for an imaginary Restaurant that focuses more on design. Was more of a break from the (at the time) complicated previous project.

- **4. GiphyClone**
  My first React Project using the Giphy API and displaying X amount of search results for a keyword.

- **5 Labert Travel** 
  A React Version (including React Router) of a mockup Travel Agency using the Contentful API as a "Backend".

- **6. Kaufmann's Recipe Site**
  A Recipe Site made in React and React Router with LOTS of (real!) content written by my grandfather who loves to cook. His best recipes of 40 years. German Website.
  A real gem for everyone who loves to cook. 
  The recipes and articles are stored in the Contentful "Backend" using their API. I also made use of react-boostrap and react-icons.

**Current Project**
Current Project: "Make Me Awesome" - a personal time tracker / self-improvement Webapp I'm developing for a friend.
Frontend: React + React Router, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Firebase + Auth, Firestore
