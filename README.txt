Welcome to my small selection of training files. 

At first, I started with countless Tutorials like FreeCodeCamp, CodeCademy and last but not least "JavaScript 30" - until I decided that I wanted to leave "Tutorial Hell" and just start building things.

Quickly, I jumped from Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS to React, since I like the reusability of React's Components and because I like "dynamic" pages that are not just static sites.
Current Project: Kaufmanns Recipe Site - a collection of my granfather's best recipes of almost 40 years. (Will be a real Website)
